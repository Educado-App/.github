Welcome to the Educado Initiative! We're a collaborative group spanning continents, composed of students, educators, and tech enthusiasts.

## Educado: Empowering Waste Pickers through Education

Waste pickers, the unsung heroes of recycling, often work in challenging environments with limited access to education. With the closure of the second largest dumpsite in the world in BrasÃ­lia, their challenges intensified.

**Educado** is our flagship mobile Android app designed specifically for waste pickers and those with low educational backgrounds. It offers:
- Tailored educational content relevant to their day-to-day lives.
- Modules on finances, health and safety, machinery operations, personal hygiene, and more.
- Flexible learning options without the need for traditional classrooms.

This initiative aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 4: Quality Education. By collaborating with Aalborg University for tech development and the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB) for design and content, we are crafting solutions tailored to real-world needs.
