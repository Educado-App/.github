## Educado: Empowering Waste Pickers through Education

Waste pickers have been the unsung heroes of recycling in many parts of the world, often working in challenging environments with limited access to education. With the closure of the second largest dumpsite in BrasÃ­lia, their challenges came to the forefront.

**Educado** is our pioneering mobile Android app crafted specifically for waste pickers and communities with low educational backgrounds. It aims to:
- Deliver tailored educational content relevant to their needs.
- Provide modules on finances, health, safety, machinery operations, and personal hygiene.
- Offer flexibility of learning without the constraints of traditional classes.

This project represents our dedication to SDG 4: Quality Education and our commitment to making education accessible to all. Through collaborations with universities such as Aalborg University and the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB), we're bridging the gap between technology and community needs.
